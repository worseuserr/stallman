# This script parses all global variables in a script according to .config
# Example: Allows %JAIL% to be converted to /thestalledones/ in any script.
# Format: %NAME% where NAME is the exact same as in .config, gets replaced by the right hand side value in .config.
# Works with both bash and python scripts as it literally edits the script after putting it in sgoinfre.
