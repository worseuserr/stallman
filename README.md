## Usage of stallman
The installation creates a symlink in your home directory, letting you run the command (default ./sm) from any terminal in /home.\

By default all terminals start in the home directory, unless you're one of those extra nerdy fucks with a custom terminal.
Stallman does not condone customized terminals.

### EXECUTION

3. From the victim pc, go to sgoinfre and type ./STA and auto fill the executor
4. Then type the **first letters** of script you want to run (example: ./STA ENO)
5. Escape
